Allows users to pick a "selected"/active character via the My Characters (/characters) page, which will then be displayed on their profile in lieu of the standard character listing. (The latter code is retained, but commented out.) The selected character display is implemented as a widget, and so can be placed elsewhere around the site at will via `@include`, e.g. `@include('selectedcharacter::_selected_character', ['character' => 'character' => Extensions\SelectedCharacter\Models\SelectedCharacterUserSettings::find(Auth::user()->id)->selectedCharacter,->settings->selectedCharacter, 'user' => Auth::user(), 'fullImage' => true])` to refer explicitly to the currently logged-in user (for instance on the user dashboard).
